# 🌤️ React Weather App

A simple and responsive weather application that displays the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city. It can automatically detect your location using geolocation and show local weather details.  

The design is inspired by Google's weather layout, as the focus of this project was functionality and API integration rather than UI design.
